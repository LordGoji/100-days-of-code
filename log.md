# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: June 19, 2022

Today's Progress: I have some previous experience with programming. I was working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science years ago and ended up quitting. So it has been many years since I have done any real programming. Because of that I'm starting out as if I'm new. I started with FreeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python course.

Thoughts: I struggled at first trying to get the Github extension to work on VS Code, and then I learned that I needed to install Git on my PC. Blew my mind haha. Then It took me a minute to figure out how to use the damn thing. But I have made progress. Then I wasn't sure where to start for coding practice so I just started with the FreeCodecamp's Scientific Computing with Python. I am very new to Git and Github, and struggled quite a bit on how to get VS Code to push/commit to my Github. It would only update my Git on my desktop. After much trial and error I finally figured it all out. Why this can't be easily explained is beyond me. I officially started just past midnight on June 19, and then started coding, after figuring out the Github stuff around 2pm. Happy Father's Day to me!
