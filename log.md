# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: June 19, 2022

Today's Progress: I figured out how to use Git/Github on my PC with Visual Studio Code. It took me a minute to figure out how it works.

Thoughts: I struggled at first trying to get the Github extension to work on VS Code, and then I learned that I needed to install Git on my PC. Blew my mind haha. Then It took me a minute to figure out how to use the damn thing. But I have made progress. Then I wasn't sure where to start for coding practice so I just started with the FreeCodecamp's Front End Curriculum. I am very new to Git and Github, and struggled quite a bit on how to get VS Code to push/commit to my Github. It would only update my Git on my desktop.
